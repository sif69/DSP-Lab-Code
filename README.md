# DSP-Lab-Code

Welcome to the **DSP-Lab-Code** repository. This repository contains basic codes for **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** experiments, ranging from simple to composite signals. These codes are designed for educational purposes and to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of DSP.



## **Overview**

The **DSP-Lab-Code** repository offers a variety of basic DSP algorithms and signal generation methods. It covers fundamental signal types such as **simple signals** (e.g., sine, unit step, unit ramp, exponential, impulse) and explores **composite signals** formed by combining multiple basic signals. These codes aim to provide a hands-on approach to understanding how digital signals are generated and processed.
